        # breadth-first search is implemented using a queue. In general, items
        # in the queue should be sorted in ascending order of their cost (and
        # some textbooks refer to this data structure as a priority queue). In
        # this case, however, all operators have the same cost (we say there is
        # no user-preference over their applicability and they are all equally
        # relevant/important), thus an ordinary list suffices for our purposes
        # as there is a bijection between depth and cost, so that inserting by
        # the back effectively sorts nodes in ascending order of their cost
        #
        # Note also, that because a queue is used, then this solver is *NOT*
        # implemented recursively but instead iteratively. Therefore, it does
        # not require any specific arguments as the start state is already given
        # to the constructor of this class
        #
        # Importantly, this implementation forces states to keep a copy of the
        # path from the start state to it. This is extraordinarily inefficient
        # and, instead, backpointers shall be used in the closed list
        # (implemented as a set below). this state space, however, is tiny (even
